 abstract = {SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python.
 It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive
 and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a
 popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents
 the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select
 submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further
 outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.},
